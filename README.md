# Isaiah-Thomas-vs.-Kyrie-Irving-Report
This is the repository for my Isaiah Thomas vs. Kyrie Irving report, which you can find [here](https://www.razeenahmad.com/portfolio). 
It primarily contains the Jupyter Notebook where I generated all my charts.
This was done using the Pandas data analysis library and matplotlib. This was the first time I used Pandas or matplotlib extensively on any project.

## Isaiah Thomas vs. Kyrie Irving.pynb
This is the Jupyter Notebook walking through all the code I used to generate my graphs.  

All graphs are generated using the csv files in the 'Data' folder.  

All graphs are saved as images in the 'Plot Images' Folder.
